# Crypto Chart

This is a Stock Charting application made primarily with the p5.js JavaScript library. The program displays
the Open/Close prices of a user inputted crypto ticker for the past 15 trading days. The application is
dynamically sized, allowing for the user to adjust their screen size with the chart adjusting accordingly.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The only program needed to run the application is a modern web browser (preferably Google Chrome or brave).

## Deployment

This program can be ran simply by opening the "index.html" file. Alternatively, the application can be deployed on an "atom-live-server" if you're using the Atom text editor. Finally, you can run the app on a node.js server if you wish to set that up yourself.
